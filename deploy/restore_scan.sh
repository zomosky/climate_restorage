# restore_scan.sh — host-side cron entry for the climate_restore slicing step.
#
# Structure mirrors download/deploy/download_run.sh: the HOST cron drives the
# long-running dev container (`zhangmy-dev`) via `docker exec`. The one difference
# from a plain container job is the lock placement:
#
#   host crontab -> flock (lock ON THE HOST) -> docker exec zhangmy-dev -> scan-once
#
# i.e. flock wraps `docker exec` on the host side, so the lock file lives on the
# host — not inside the container. This keeps overlapping cron ticks from stacking
# two scans while the host `docker exec` client is alive (it stays attached until
# the in-container run exits). scan-once is idempotent anyway, so the lock is a
# resource guard, not a correctness requirement.
#
# It idempotently sweeps every *.manifest.json under DATA_ROOT (inside the
# container) and turns each finished init into a per-source Zarr store. Re-runs are
# cheap: already-built outputs are skipped (keyed off the on-disk .zarr).
#
# Install (host crontab), every 10 minutes:
#   */10 * * * * /srv/climate/restore_scan.sh >> /var/log/climate/restore_scan.log 2>&1
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - the dev container is running and stays up (cron drives it via `docker exec`)
#   - the cron user can run docker (in the `docker` group or root)
#   - restore deps synced once inside it:
#       docker exec -w /workspace/climate_restorage zhangmy-dev uv sync
#
# Any value below can be overridden from the environment if your layout differs.
